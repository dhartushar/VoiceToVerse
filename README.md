# VoiceToVerse

Transcribe audio files with speaker diarization using state-of-the-art open-source models — built with FastAPI and powered by `faster-whisper` and `pyannote.audio`.

---

## Overview

**VoiceToVerse** is an API service that:

- Transcribes spoken content using [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper)
- Identifies *who spoke when* using [`pyannote.audio`](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) (speaker diarization)
- Accepts common audio formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.mp4`, `.avi`
- Returns structured transcripts with timestamps and speaker labels
- Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy integration

> ⚠️ Speaker diarization may take longer than transcription — allow a few extra seconds for response.
